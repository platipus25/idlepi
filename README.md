# Idle Pi

An idle game, where the objective is to calculate the decimal digits of pi.

For now it is entirely client side, written in [solidjs](https://solidjs.com).

Package mangement is handled through `bun`.

## Building

`bun install`

### `bun run dev`
- Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>


### `bun run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Idle pi is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
